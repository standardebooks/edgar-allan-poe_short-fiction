			<p>I am⁠—that is to say I was⁠—a great man; but I am neither the author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe, is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of Fum-Fudge.</p>
			<p>The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius⁠—my father wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I mastered before I was breeched.</p>
			<p>I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone. Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed a half dozen of drams.</p>
			<p>When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step with him into his study.</p>
			<p>“My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of your existence?”</p>
			<p>“My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”</p>
			<p>“And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”</p>
			<p>“Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”</p>
			<p>“And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a nose?”</p>
			<p>“A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I pulled out my watch.] “It is now noon, or thereabouts⁠—we shall have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To commence then:⁠—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that protuberance⁠—that bump⁠—that excrescence⁠—that⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am thunderstruck at the extent of your information⁠—I am positively⁠—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his hand upon his heart.] “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.] “Your education may now be considered as finished⁠—it is high time you should scuffle for yourself⁠—and you cannot do a better thing than merely follow your nose⁠—so⁠—so⁠—so⁠—” [Here he kicked me downstairs and out of the door.]⁠—“So get out of my house, and God bless you!”</p>
			<p>As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology forthwith.</p>
			<p>All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.</p>
			<p>“Wonderful genius!” said the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Quarterly</i>.</p>
			<p>“Superb physiologist!” said the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Westminster</i>.</p>
			<p>“Clever fellow!” said the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Foreign</i>.</p>
			<p>“Fine writer!” said the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Edinburgh</i>.</p>
			<p>“Profound thinker!” said the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Dublin</i>.</p>
			<p>“Great man!” said <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Bentley</i>.</p>
			<p>“Divine soul!” said <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Fraser</i>.</p>
			<p>“One of us!” said <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Blackwood</i>.</p>
			<p>“Who can he be?” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bas-Bleu.</p>
			<p>“What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.</p>
			<p>“Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.⁠—But I paid these people no attention whatever⁠—I just stepped into the shop of an artist.</p>
			<p>The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.</p>
			<p>I approached the artist and turned up my nose.</p>
			<p>“Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.</p>
			<p>“Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.</p>
			<p>“Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.</p>
			<p>“Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.</p>
			<p>“What will you take for it?” asked the artist.</p>
			<p>“For his nose!” shouted her Grace.</p>
			<p>“A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.</p>
			<p>“A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.</p>
			<p>“A thousand pounds,” said I.</p>
			<p>“Beautiful!” said he, entranced.</p>
			<p>“A thousand pounds,” said I.</p>
			<p>“Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.</p>
			<p>“I do,” said I, blowing it well.</p>
			<p>“Is it <em>quite</em> original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.</p>
			<p>“Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.</p>
			<p>“Has <em>no</em> copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a microscope.</p>
			<p>“None,” said I, turning it up.</p>
			<p>“<em>Admirable!</em>” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre.</p>
			<p>“A thousand pounds,” said I.</p>
			<p>“A <em>thousand</em> pounds?” said he.</p>
			<p>“Precisely,” said I.</p>
			<p>“A thousand <em>pounds</em>?” said he.</p>
			<p>“Just so,” said I.</p>
			<p>“You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the ninety-ninth edition of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Nosology</i>, with a portrait of the proboscis.⁠—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me to dinner.</p>
			<p>We were all lions and recherchés.</p>
			<p>There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus, Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.</p>
			<p>There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price, Priestly, Condorcêt, De Staël, and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ambitious Student in Ill-Health</i>.</p>
			<p>There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.</p>
			<p>There was Aestheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms; bi-part and preexistent soul; affinity and discord; primitive intelligence and homoömeria.</p>
			<p>There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus; heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism; Homousios and Homouioisios.</p>
			<p>There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with velouté sauce; veal à la <abbr>St.</abbr> Menehoult; marinade à la <abbr>St.</abbr> Florentin; and orange jellies <i xml:lang="fr">en mosaïques</i>.</p>
			<p>There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and <abbr>St.</abbr> George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon <abbr>St.</abbr> Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.</p>
			<p>There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino⁠—of the gloom of Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.</p>
			<p>There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.</p>
			<p>There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of green horns.</p>
			<p>There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the eighty-three lost tragedies of Aeschylus; of the fifty-four orations of Isaeus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus; of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty tragedies of Homer Junior.</p>
			<p>There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms, fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about blende and hornblende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.</p>
			<p>There was myself. I spoke of myself;⁠—of myself, of myself, of myself;⁠—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up my nose, and I spoke of myself.</p>
			<p>“Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.</p>
			<p>“Superb!” said his guests;⁠—and next morning her Grace of Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.</p>
			<p>“Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me under the chin.</p>
			<p>“Upon honor,” said I.</p>
			<p>“Nose and all?” she asked.</p>
			<p>“As I live,” I replied.</p>
			<p>“Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”</p>
			<p>“Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”</p>
			<p>“Pshaw, no!⁠—but with all your nose?”</p>
			<p>“Every bit of it, my love,” said I:⁠—so I gave it a twist or two, and found myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to suffocation.</p>
			<p>“He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.</p>
			<p>“He is coming!” said somebody farther up.</p>
			<p>“He is coming!” said somebody farther still.</p>
			<p>“He is come!” exclaimed the Duchess. “He is come, the little love!”⁠—and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice upon the nose. A marked sensation immediately ensued.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="it">Diavolo!</i>” cried Count Capricornutti.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="es">Dios guarda!</i>” muttered Don Stiletto.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Mille tonnerres!</i>” ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="de">Tousand teufel!</i>” growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.</p>
			<p>It was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short upon Bluddennuff.</p>
			<p>“Sir!” said I to him, “you are a baboon.”</p>
			<p>“Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “<i xml:lang="de">Donner und Blitzen!</i>”</p>
			<p>This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose⁠—and then called upon my friends.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Bête!</i>” said the first.</p>
			<p>“Fool!” said the second.</p>
			<p>“Dolt!” said the third.</p>
			<p>“Ass!” said the fourth.</p>
			<p>“Ninny!” said the fifth.</p>
			<p>“Noodle!” said the sixth.</p>
			<p>“Be off!” said the seventh.</p>
			<p>At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.</p>
			<p>“Father,” I asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?”</p>
			<p>“My son,” he replied, “it is still the study of Nosology; but in hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark. You have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none. You are damned, and he has become the hero of the day. I grant you that in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of his proboscis⁠—but, good heavens! there is no competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all.”</p>
